# Contributing to Flock XR
Hey there! We welcome community contributions to Flock XR. This could be **code**, **documentation**, **reporting bugs**, **suggesting accessibility features**, **adding translations**, or something else!

## Current priorities
- Stability
- Adding tests
- Accessibility features

## Code of conduct
In future, we'll add our own code of conduct, for now we follow: [p5.js Web Editor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting started
We welcome contributors with lots of experience through to those considering their first open source contribution. 

Contact us via [Get in touch](https://flipcomputing.com/contact/) and we'll invite you to our Discord to chat about how you could help. Thank you!
